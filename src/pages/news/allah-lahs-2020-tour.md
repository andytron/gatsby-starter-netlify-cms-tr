REVERBERATION RADIO LIVE (THE RETURN) ART SHOW BY ROBBIE SIMON

Drawing in an international line-up of highly regarded creatives, the festival will launch with an art show at [The Slow](//theslow.id/) by multi-disciplinary Californian artist, [Robbie Simon](//www.robbiesimon.com/). Known for his Iconic record covers and minimalist style, his work plays on abstract graphics and bright colours, melding mid century modern with 1960's euphoria.
